# New beginnings 

Here is a couplet [Dr. Bashir Badr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashir_Badr).

>	कोई फूल धूप की पत्तियों में हरे रिबन से बँधा हुआ 

>	वो ग़ज़ल का लहजा नया नया न कहा हुआ न सुना हुआ 

Here's a translation in English:

>	A flower, leaves seemingly like the sun, tied together with a green ribbon,

>	The poetry here is very new, never before seen, never before heard of.

You can continue reading the rest of the poem [here](https://rekhta.org/ghazals/koii-phuul-dhuup-kii-pattiyon-men-hare-ribbon-se-bandhaa-huaa-bashir-badr-ghazals?lang=Hi).

Note that the word _ribbon_ used here is the same word that he used in his _urdu ghazal_. This word is an adapted word. Badr, a professor of _urdu_ and a doctorate in _urdu_ literature would have surely known that the "pure" word would have been फ़ीता  (_feeta_), but it is difficult to argue that it will invoke the same imagery. The shock of the language switch beautifully breaks away Badr's _sher_ from the contemporary _shayars_ of that time. He audaciously makes a bold move and indeed demonstrates how new his poetry is.

With this beautiful _sher_, I would like to introduce you to my new blog. This blog will be many things! But most importanly, it will be new, never before seen, never before heard of!


# Why a blog?

I recently started to feel that I had a lot to say but did not take the time to write it. It's not that I want anyone in particular to read it, but I really wouldn't mind if they do!

# But why a new one?

Some of you might know about an old blog that I used to run. I used to host it on [wordpress](http://wordpress.com) which is an ad-supported blogging platform. This is something that I do not subscribe to philosophically, and I would really like to have all of my content for free.

Also, I want to be able to write in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), which is much more easy to type in than the unwieldy rich-text format over there. This means that I can just write a blog post in my favorite text editor (which undoubtably is [vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor))).


# Technological stuff

Currently, this blog is hosted on my [github](https://github.com/Breakfastisready). That still does put it under the mercy the giant _Microsoft_. But it's still an improvement over capitalizing over my innoncent audience.

This blog is run using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which is a nice open-source toolkit to generate static websites such as this one. Currently, this means that adding comments under my blog is not possible. I might be able to fix this in the future by perhaps relying on an external functionality like [utterances](https://utteranc.es/). But right now, if there is any feedback on my blog posts, you can write an [e-mail](mailto:secretcatparty@tutanota.com).

Soon, I will have a mailing list, RSS/atom and the usual shenanigans.
