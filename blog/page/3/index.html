    <p>Lately, I had seen a film called Salim Langde pe mat ro. I wrote a review of that film in a previous blog post. I had really liked that film, so I tried to watch another film by the same director Saeed Mirza called Albert Pinto ko gussa kyon aata hai. The title in English would translate as &ldquo;Why does Albert Pinto get angry?&rdquo;.
In this post, I will give a spoiler free review of the film and my thoughts about it.<span> <a href="https://www.breakfastisready.xyz/blog/2021/01/albert-pinto-ko-gussa-kyun-aata-hai-review/">Read more...</a></span>

    <p>The following is my discussion about a ghazal written by the Urdu poet Mir Taqi Mir. But who is he?
Mir Taqi Mir (1723-1810) was a contemporary of Mirza Ghalib operating in the city of Lucknow. He was one of the first Urdu poets and he has pretty much shaped the language itself. Of course comparisons will be made between Mir and Ghalib and Wikipedia even has this section about what Ghalib said about Mir.<span> <a href="https://www.breakfastisready.xyz/blog/2021/01/why-cry-at-how-long-the-path-of-love-is/">Read more...</a></span>

    <p>I just saw a fantastic film called Salim Langde pe mat ro. This film was suggested to me by RS. In this post, I will give a spoiler free review of the film and my thoughts about it.
The entire film is on Youtube. You can watch it below.
  What is it about? It&rsquo;s definitely not some famous film and the name sounds bizarre. An English translation of the name would be &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry for Salim the Lame&rdquo;.<span> <a href="https://www.breakfastisready.xyz/blog/2021/01/salim-langde-pe-mat-ro-review/">Read more...</a></span>

    <p>This is in continuation to a previous post, which you can read here. In that post, I try to lay out all the facets of my personality that I am unhappy with and I would like to vanish along with the year 2020. This post will be more hopeful and will lay out how I could change what I was and what lies on the path ahead. These will be the answer to the grievances, my jawab-e-shikwa.<span> <a href="https://www.breakfastisready.xyz/blog/2020/12/here-cometh-2021/">Read more...</a></span>

    <p>Yesterday, I was watching the Netflix show Death to 2020. It&rsquo;s a funny mockumentry with a stellar starcast about a horrible year that will be over soon. Watch the trailer here. It is up to anyone&rsquo;s guess what 2021 will be like, but by all means it is very difficult for the coming year to be worse than what it was.
Personally, it was a horrible year for myself too. With the pandemic spreading, I joined Twitter to keep up with all the developments and quickly developed opinions about Indian politics and climate change, some of which I will consider quite radical now.<span> <a href="https://www.breakfastisready.xyz/blog/2020/12/death-to-my-2020-self/">Read more...</a></span>
