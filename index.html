    <p>Recently, I had some discussions with a friend of mine. Let&rsquo;s call this person X.
In a tweet that I had recently posted, I expressed interest in knowing better the history of Tipu Sultan. I am interested in Indian history in general, that the politically controversial nature of Tipu&rsquo;s legacy makes it worth knowing more about this topic.
X had some strong opinions about this topic and X quickly started confronting me about it.<span> <a href="https://www.breakfastisready.xyz/blog/2022/04/exchanges-with-a-friend/">Read more...</a></span>

    <p>Hello! How are you, my dear blog?
Today I went to the local swimming pool to learn to swim. I am not very good ad this activity. In this post, I&rsquo;m just going to blurt out some thoughts about what I think about all this.
This is going to be a bunch of advice for people who want to get into it, or mostly just a set of instructions that I want to remember myself<span> <a href="https://www.breakfastisready.xyz/blog/2021/12/learning-to-swim/">Read more...</a></span>

    <p>This is a film review of the film Court. This film has been around since 2014 but I just saw it.
Follow the spoiler warnings and you can read this review without getting the film spoiled.
What is it about? It is a courtroom drama created by some guy called Chaitanya Tamhane. The film tries very hard to show a realistic courtroom
 The film is also very much about race relations in the United States.<span> <a href="https://www.breakfastisready.xyz/blog/2021/05/court-review/">Read more...</a></span>
